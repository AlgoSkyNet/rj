Utils.R:

   getAll():  reads the Submissions directory, and returns an R list, one
      element 'des' per submission, basically summarizing the DESCRIPTION
      file; list is indexed by manuscript number, e.g. subs[['2018-52']]
   getTitle(des):  extracts title from 'des'
   getDESbyAut(aut):  returns ms number(s) for e-mail address of 1st author
   getAutInfo(des):  extracts author info
   getAutAddr(des):  extracts author e-mail address
   getEd(des):  extracts editor name
   setEd(des):  sets editor name
   getReviewStatus(des) extracts review status
   autAdd(aut)  get lead author's e-mail address from aut name
   pullRepo():  git pull origin, and call getAll() 
   makeSysCmd(...):  aids in setting up quotes commands for system()
   pushToGitHub(fileList,commitComment,op,mvdest): 
      if op is 'add', pushes the files to GitHub, or if 'mv' does mv of
      fileList to mv dest; then comment for 'commit -m'
   ghPush():  does the actual pushing, with a loop to deal with mistyped
      passwords
   editPush(fname,commitComment):  edit the given file, then push to GitHub
   sendLetter(msNum,surname,addr,subject,template,attaches): send letter
      to author, e.g. conditional acceptance
   mailIt(addr,subject,attaches,ltr,mailer='muttMailer'):  e-mail letter 
   getLocalDirName():  get last part of path, e.g. z from /x/y/z 

ACK.R:

   ack(msNum):  sends acknowledgement of receipt of manuscript

Reject.R:

   reject(msNum):  performs all needed operations -- updates the
      DESCRIPTION file, git-moves the directory to Rejected; sends
      letter to the author; pushes to GitHub; first displays to the
      editor the DESCRIPTION file, so the editor can double-check that
      this is the right one

ConditAccept.R:

   conditAcc():  like reject() above, performing all ops except, for
      now, sending the letter

Accept.R:

    accept():  performs all needed operations -- updates the
       DESCRIPTION file, git-moves the directory to Accepted; sends
       letter to the author; pushes new author files, DESCRIPTION etc.
       to GitHub; first displays to the
       editor the DESCRIPTION file, so the editor can double-check that
       this is the right one
