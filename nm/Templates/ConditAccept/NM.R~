# in-place string concatenation; appends the strings in ... to str1,
# assigning back to str1 (at least in name, if not memory location), in
# the spirit of string.append() in Python; here DOTS is one of more
# expressions separated by commas, with each expression being either a
# string or a vector of strings; within a vector, innersep is used as a
# separator, while between vectors it is outersep

# example:

# > x <- 'abc'
# > ipstrcat(x,'de')
# NULL
# > x
# [1] "abcde"
