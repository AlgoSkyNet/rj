Dear {{name}},

Your article is scheduled to be published in the next volume of the R journal. However, since you have submitted your article, we have tweaked a number of aspects of the submission process and the RJournal style file and we need a final round of proof reading. You can find an updated version of the author guidelines at http://rjournal.github.io/share/author-guide.pdf. In particular, please make sure that your submission:

* Includes a .bib file

* Looks good in the new one-column style. You may need to switch figures from columns to rows, and please note the presence of the widefigure and widetable environments.

* Does not include any large pdf files that take a long time to render.

Feel free to fix any either small errors you spot at this time, and if you haven't already, work through the author checklist attached to this email.

By Friday June 14, please either:

* Acknowledge that the existing article looks ok, you're happy for it to be published, and you've worked through the attached checklist.

* Return a modified tex file, along with a bulleted list of the changes you've made.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Hadley
