Dear {{name}},

I'm pleased to let you know that your article has been accepted for
publication in the R journal. The next steps are as follows:

* Ensure that you're using the most recent version of the style file 
  and wrapper available http://journal.r-project.org/submissions.html

* Please proofread your article carefully according to the checklist at
  http://journal.r-project.org/share/proofreading-checklist.pdf

Once that's done, I will make the article available in the online preview, and it will appear in the next issue of the journal.  Between now and then, we will contact you once more about final copy-editing changes.

Regards,

Hadley
