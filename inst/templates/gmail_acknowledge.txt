Dear {{name}},

We are pleased to receive your submission "{{title}}" to the R Journal. It has been given id {{id}}; please use that in future correspondence.

The submission process proceeds as follows:

* review by editorial board & assignment of associate editor (~1-2 weeks)
* reviewers solicited (~1-2 weeks)
* reviews received (~1-2 months)

You should expect to hear from us again within 3 months.

Should you not have included an R script to replicate examples in your submission, could I please request that you send me such a file at your earliest convenience?

Could I at this time also ask you to add any missing but available DOI fields to your *.bib file, removing extraneous URL fields? There is no need to send them now, but missing DOI fields should be in the next version of that file that we receive.

Best wishes,

{{me}}
