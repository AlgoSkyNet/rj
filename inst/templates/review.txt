Dear {{name}},

Would you be interested in reviewing the attached article, "{{title}}" for the R Journal? I think the topic is a good fit with your interests and expertise.

The structure of the review is up to you, but is typically around a page in length and will include comments on the following topics:

* Overall recommendation: Accept with minor revisions (you won't see it again), accept with major revisions (you'll be asked to review the revisions), or rejected.

* Overview: Is this article of importance to R community? Have the authors taken a sensible approach? Are technology and methods up-to-date?

* Article: Is anything unclear? Is anything missing (e.g. references, key features of package)? Are the examples helpful? IS there sufficient background (including alternative approaches in R)? Is the approach statistically sound?

* Package: Could the functions presented be improved (user interface, output)? You're not required to test the package, but authors typically appreciate efforts to check their code.

The review should be anonymous and returned to me by email in plain text, or as a pdf. 

Please let me know if you are willing to take on this review. I would
like to receive the review, if possible, by {{date}}.

Regards,

{{me}}
